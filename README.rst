Release 0.2.0
-------------

We are pleased to announce the release of CubeViz, a visualization and analysis tool for data cubes from integral field units (IFUs). This is an early release (v0.2.0) and we would appreciate your feedback.  It is built on top of the “glue” visualization tool.

.. role:: bash(code)
   :language: bash
   
To install:
  * Install minconda3 if it is not on your system
  * Then type: :bash:`conda create -n cubeviz020 -c glueviz cubeviz`

More installation instructions will be on the RTD page (currently incorrectly displaying the wrong docs and appears to be an RTD bug).

If you run into any issues or have suggestions for new features, we encourage you to create issues on GitHub or send comments to https://www.susankassin.com/contact/

This release requires Python 3.5 or 3.6.
